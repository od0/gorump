# gorump
go on rumprun

This repo is based on Go the source 1.5.1 stable c7d78ba4df574b5f9a9bb5d17505f40c4d89b81c
downloaded at https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.5.1.src.tar.gz .

On top, the NetBSD platform has been modified to support Rumprun instead.
To generate a patch: `git diff go-1-5-1-upstream master`.

See `examples` directory on how to build and use.

### Getting Started

#### Install Go
```
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.5.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xzf go1.5*
```

#### Build Go
```
CC=x86_64-rumprun-netbsd-gcc CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=netbsd /usr/local/go/bin/go build -buildmode=c-archive -v -a -x main.go
```

#### Download Rumprun

```
git clone https://github.com/rumpkernel/rumprun
git pull origin master
git submodule update --init
CC=cc ./build-rr.sh hw
```

TODO
====

* setup testing
* separate Rumprun from NetBSD (done that way because it avoided
  duplicating everything for the initial experiment)
* remove remaining instances of SYSCALL from `sys_netbsd_amd64.s`
* add i386 support (if someone wants a hobby)
* figure out what to do about TLS and goroutines (rump kernels and
  bmk use TLS)
* base maximum memory size on how much memory the Rumprun guest has,
  not a hardcoded limit
* fix arg{c,v} passing.  Go init wants them before we have them
  available in Rumprun.  Also, remove the kludge_arg{c,v} hacks.
* figure out a way to automatically launch a Go program with `main()`
  as a guest instead of requiring editing the Go program to `//export`
  something and writing a matching `.c` stub file
